##  Academic Projects 

 **A Bangla Text Search Engine Using Pointwise Approach of Learn to Rank(LtR) Algorithm**  
 • A web application that provides search result of a user query in Bangla in a particular ranked order. This project is
 a combination of ML, NLP, Web crawling. Applied the Point-wise Approach of Learn to Rank Algorithm instead of
 using the conventional BM25 function.  
 **Language:** Python, HTML, CSS, **DB:** MySQL **IDE:** PyCharm **Others:** Flask API, Google Colab  
 
 **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms**  
 • Applied machine learning classifiers to implement a heart disease prediction model using ECG dataset.
 Website for High School Science Contents
